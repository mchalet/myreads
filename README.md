# My Reads - Udacity Project #1

## Description
This is my take on the MyReads app. MyReads is a bookshelf app with the purpose of allowing users to search for and categorize books they are reading, want to read, or have read. 

## Getting Started
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/mchalet/myreads.git` to clone this repository.
2. Move to this new directory with `cd myreads`.
3. `npm install` 
4. `npm start`

## Todos

1. Clean up UI.
2. Debounce Search component error message.
3. Implement drag & drop between shelves.
